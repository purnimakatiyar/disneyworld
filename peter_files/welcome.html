Peter Pan's Flight is a suspended dark ride at the Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland, and Shanghai Disneyland theme parks. 
Located in Fantasyland, it is one of the few remaining attractions that was operational on Disneyland's opening day in 1955. 
The ride's story, music, staging and artwork are based on Walt Disney's Peter Pan, the animated film version of the classic Peter Pan story by J. M. Barrie.
 The ride is one of Disneyland's most acclaimed and popular attractions</i></font> <br> <br>

Disney does “dark rides” better than any other amusement park. 
A Disney dark ride is generally a slow-paced trip through tableaux that recreate a beloved Disney film or a particular theme or motif. 
Think the Fantasyland rides based on classic Disney movies, or the ghosts and pirates of the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. 
Peter Pan’s Flight might have the single most beautiful image of any Disney attraction, as your galleon flies over the dimly lit streets of London at night. 
It’s a timeless Disney ride.<br> <br><br>

Guests hear Peter Pan saying, "Come on, everybody! Here we go!" At this point, the ship flies out the nursery window and over moonlit London. 
Lights twinkle all around. 
Below guests are miniature versions of some of London's famous landmarks, including St. Paul's Cathedral, Big Ben, the Tower Bridge and the River Thames.
