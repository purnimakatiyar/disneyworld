Thunder Mountain is the best rollercoaster in the world if you’re an eight-year-old frightened to death of rollercoasters. 
It’s the perfect intermediary between a kid’s coaster like Gadget’s Go Coaster at Mickey’s Toontown and the scarier and more complex coasters you’d ride at other amusement parks. 
It’s a fun, fast, basic rollercoaster with exciting twists and dips and a great theme ripped straight from old Hollywood westerns.<br><br>

Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was designed by Imagineer Tony Baxter and ride design engineer Bill Watkins. 
The concept came from Baxter's work on fellow Imagineer Marc Davis's concept for the Western River Expedition, 
a western-themed pavilion at the Magic Kingdom, designed to look like an enormous plateau and contain many rides
