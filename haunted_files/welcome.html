<p>The Haunted Mansion is a dark ride attraction located at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, and Tokyo Disneyland.
The attraction, although differing slightly in every location, places riders inside a haunted manor resided by "999 happy haunts".
</p></i></font><p><font face="salina" size="5" color="orchid"><i>The Haunted Mansion features a ride-through tour in Omnimover vehicles called "Doom Buggies", and a walk-through show is displayed to riders waiting in the line queue. 
The attraction utilizes a range of technology, from centuries-old theatrical effects to modern special effects featuring spectral Audio-Animatronics. 
The Haunted Mansion has inspired two similarly-themed attractions, Phantom Manor and Mystic Manor, which exist at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland, respectively.<br><br>

The Haunted Mansion is an absolute classic that sets a standard that all other haunted houses have failed to meet. 
Frightening as a kid, gleeful as an adult, it’s like a Tim Burton movie come to life (but, you know, one of the good ones.) 
The Disneyland version has a few differences from the one I grew up with in Orlando, and I think I prefer the Disney World version to this one.
 Still, the original is a joyously macabre ride through a gothic nightmare.<br><br>

Entering the Hall of Mirrors, the Doom Buggies pass a group of three ghosts thumbing for a ride. Around the corner, in large, ornately framed mirrors,
 the guests see that one of the ghosts from the trio is in the carriage with them.<br>

While passing through the Hall of Mirrors, the same Singing Bust spirits from the Graveyard sing a somber tune in the background while guests proceed to the exit.
