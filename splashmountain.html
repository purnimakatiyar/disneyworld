Splash Mountain is a log flume with some dark ride scenes at Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, and the Magic Kingdom 
at the Walt Disney World Resort, based on the characters, stories, and songs from the 1946 Disney film Song of the South.
Although there are variations in the story and features between the three locations, 
each installation begins with a peaceful outdoor float-through that leads to indoor dark ride segments,
with a climactic steep drop into a "briar patch" followed by an indoor finale. 
The drop is 50 feet (15 m).</i>

Yes, Joel Chandler Harris's work is problematic, to say the least. 
There's a good reason Song of the South essentially ceased to exist in America in the mid 80s. 
Celebrating a log flume ride based upon Disney's animated adaptations of Harris's interpretation of African-American folklore is in no way celebrating or defending those interpretations or their adaptations. 
It's merely pointing out that falling 50 feet in a fake log and getting soaked after listening to a catchy song is a fun thing to do on 
a hot summer afternoon.<br> <br>

The plot behind Splash Mountain is a composite of several Uncle Remus stories. 
The different versions of Splash Mountain feature similar stories, albeit with small differences. 
Each ride presents scenes taken from the animated segments of Song of the South, telling the story of Br'er Rabbit, the protagonist, a mischievous hero who leaves his home in search of adventure. 
Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear, the antagonists of the story, are determined to catch him, 
but are repeatedly tricked into letting him free.</i>
