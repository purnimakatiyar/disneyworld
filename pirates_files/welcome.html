Pirates of the Caribbean is a log flume dark ride at Disneyland, the Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Park in Paris. 
The original version at Disneyland, which opened in 1967, was the last attraction whose construction was overseen by Walt Disney; he died three months before it opened.
The ride, which tells the story of a band of pirates and their troubles and exploits, was replicated at the Magic Kingdom in 1973, at Tokyo Disneyland in 1983, and at Disneyland Paris in 1992. Each of the initial four versions of the ride has a different façade, but a similar ride experience.
 A reimagined version of the ride, Pirates of the Caribbean – Battle for the Sunken Treasure,
 opened at the Shanghai Disneyland Park in 2016.<br><br>

Pirates of the Caribbean has been one of Disney’s top attractions since it first opened in 1967, decades before the movies, and it doesn’t need to reference them to retain its magic.
 The ride today is mostly the same as what you remember from childhood, a slow boat ride through a beautiful and comical recreation of Hollywood-style pirate scenes, only Disney has now tried to imprint the barest outline of a story involving Jack Sparrow. 
It’s easy to ignore it if you need to, and the classic scenes you remember from the ride are still here.
 Pirates of the Caribbean blew the dark ride concept up to an epic scale, and remains a triumph of fantasy-building.<br><br>

<br> The ride gave rise to the song "Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)" written by George Bruns and Xavier Atencio. 
It also became the basis for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, which debuted in 2003. 
Since 2006, Disney has incorporated characters from the film series into the Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, and Tokyo Disneyland versions of the rides.
