 Space Mountain (currently called Hyperspace Mountain) is a space-themed indoor steel roller coaster in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Opened on May 27, 1977,
 it was the second roller coaster built at Disneyland,
 and was the second of the five versions of Space Mountain built by The Walt Disney Company. 
Its exterior façade is one of Disneyland's four "mountain" structures that serve as park landmarks.<br><br>

<br> <br>Space Mountain is the best amusement park attraction in the world.
 This exciting blast through a starlit void combines two things that will always be amazing to kids of all ages:
 rollercoasters and outer space.
 Thankfully Disney hasn’t updated the overall aesthetic of Space Mountain that much since it was introduced in the 1970s. 
What was futuristic when I was young is now retrofuturistic in a fun and campy way. 
Between the Star Wars via NASA imagery and the Moroder-with-a-theremin feel of the soundtrack, Space Mountain is like a time machine back to 1982, especially when it lets you out in an arcade full of old videogames. 
(Guess who got the high score in Robotron last time he was there?) Part of why old people like me still love Disney is nostalgia, and that nostalgia doesn’t get more exciting or more powerful than with Space Mountain.<br><br>

Space Mountain has undergone a number of major upgrades and refurbishments over the years, including the addition of an onboard soundtrack in 1996, 
repainting of the exterior in 1997 and 2003, and a complete replacement of the original track and ride vehicles from 2003 to 2005.[2]
 It has also been given a third roof up the mountain during late 2013 and early 2014. 
Every September during Halloween Time at Disneyland, the mountain is given projections for the Ghost Galaxy event. 
Most recently in November 2015, Space Mountain was given a new overlay and theme in anticipation for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
